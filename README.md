# ICS Cybersecurity Labs â€“ Praveen

This repository tracks my hands-on learning journey from 20+ years in control systems to specializing in cybersecurity for industrial systems (ICS/OT). It includes:

- TryHackMe labs
- ICS-specific security experiments (OpenPLC, Modbus, Wireshark)
- Detection and SOC analysis exercises
