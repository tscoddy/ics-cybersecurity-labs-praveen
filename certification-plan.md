# ðŸŽ“ Cybersecurity Certification Plan (Control Systems Focus)

This document outlines my roadmap for certifications aligned with cybersecurity in industrial and OT environments.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Completed

- âœ… **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** (2024)  
  Foundation in cybersecurity concepts, SOC roles, SIEM tools, and incident response.

---

## ðŸ“˜ In Progress

## ðŸŽ¯ Planned (2025â€“2026)

| Cert | Target Date | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **CompTIA Security+** | Aug 2025 | Industry-recognized baseline cert for cybersecurity. |
| **GIAC GICSP** | Q4 2025 | Gold standard for ICS/OT security professionals. |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Defender (MAD ICS)** | Early 2026 | Threat-informed defense, focused on industrial networks. |
| **SANS SEC450 / GCIA** | Late 2026 | Strong foundation in intrusion analysis and network defense. |

## ðŸ”® Long-Term / Optional

- ðŸ“Œ **CISSP** â€“ Governance-heavy, not a current priority but may be relevant later.
- ðŸ“Œ **ISA/IEC 62443 Certificates** â€“ For deep industrial protocol + OT risk work.
